## Project 2

* The data consists of cars information including id, car make, car model, car model year and car color. 
* The controller consists of the js file which has the data fetching methods, getAll and getById
* I have created 5 textboxes so as to filter data based on each field.
* I have also created 'apply filter' which will apply the filters based on the search field input.
* The form also consists of a reset button to remove all fillters.
* When the user clicks on 'apply filter' button the data in the form is fetched and passed to the getAll function and the getAll function fetches the data, applies the filters that were passed to it, and the data returned by it is used to render the table to show output to the user.
